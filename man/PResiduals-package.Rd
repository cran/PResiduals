\title{Computes probability-scale residuals and residual correlations.}
\description{
This package outputs probability-scale residuals from multiple
models and computes residual correlation.  Probability-scale
residual can be computed for continuous, ordinal, binary, count,
and time-to-event data (although the current implementation is only
for ordinal variables). Plots of probability-scale residuals can be
useful for model diagnostics.  Residual correlation can be used to
test for conditional independence between multiple types of
variables.
