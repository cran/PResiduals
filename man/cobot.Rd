\usage{
cobot(formula, link = c("logit", "probit", "cloglog", "loglog", "cauchit"),
  link.x = link, link.y = link, data, subset, na.action = na.fail,
  fisher = TRUE, conf.int = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{\link{Formula}} (or one
that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the
model to be fitted.  The details of model specification are given
under \sQuote{Details}.}

\item{link}{The link family to be used for ordinal models of both
\var{X} and \var{Y}.  Defaults to \samp{logit}. Other options are
\samp{probit}, \samp{cloglog},\samp{loglog}, and \samp{cauchit}.}

\item{link.x}{The link function to be used for a model of the first
ordered variable. Defaults to value of \code{link}.}

\item{link.y}{The link function to be used for a model of the
second variable. Defaults to value of \code{link}.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object
coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame)
containing the variables in the model.  If not found in
\code{data}, the variables are taken from
\code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which
\code{cobot} is called.}

\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of
observations to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{na.action}{how \code{NA}s are treated.}

\item{fisher}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, Fisher transformation and delta method a
used to compute p value for the test statistic based on correlation of
residuals.}

\item{conf.int}{numeric specifying confidence interval coverage.}
}
\value{
object of \samp{cobot} class.

\description{
\code{cobot} tests for independence between two ordered categorical
variables, \var{X} and \var{Y} conditional on other variables,
\var{Z}.  The basic approach involves fitting models of \var{X} on
\var{Z} and \var{Y} on \var{Z} and determining whether there is any
remaining information between \var{X} and \var{Y}.  This is done by
computing one of 3 test statistics.  \code{T1} compares empirical
distribution of \var{X} and \var{Y} with the joint fitted
distribution of \var{X} and \var{Y} under independence conditional
on \var{Z}. \code{T2} computes the correlation between ordinal
(probability-scale) residuals from both models and tests the null
of no residual correlation.  \code{T3} evaluates the
concordance--disconcordance of data drawn from the joint fitted
distribution of \var{X} and \var{Y} under conditional independence
with the empirical distribution. Details are given in \cite{Li C and
Shepherd BE, Test of association between two ordinal variables
while adjusting for covariates. Journal of the American Statistical
Association 2010, 105:612-620}.

\details{
formula is specified as \code{\var{X} | \var{Y} ~ \var{Z}}.
This indicates that models of \code{\var{X} ~ \var{Z}} and
\code{\var{Y} ~ \var{Z}} will be fit.  The null hypothsis to be
tested is \eqn{H_0 : X}{H0 : X} independant of \var{Y} conditional
on \var{Z}.

Note that \code{T2} can be thought of as an adjusted rank
correlation.(\cite{Li C and Shepherd BE, A new residual for ordinal
outcomes. Biometrika 2012; 99:473-480})
